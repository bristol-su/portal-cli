# Atlas CLI

## Installation

Once we publish releases it'll be a static URL to download the phar file. For now, we should
- Clone this repository `git clone git@github.com:ElbowSpaceUK/atlas-cli`.
- cd into the cloned repository and run `composer install`
- You can now run commands using `php atlas`

## Usage

Add an alias for `atlas="php /full/path/to/cloned/repo/atlas"` so atlas can be referenced with just `atlas`.

You should always run `atlas setup` after any updates to atlas.
